Sadly, last night Laura broke her ankle. She was taking out the garbage when everything went wrong.
She took one wrong step and it was game over for her evening and her ankles.

Laura broke her ankle :(

**UPDATE 2016-02-21**

She's entirely back to normal :) It didn't take 3 years, but I saw this
post again and decided that it just sounded too grim.
