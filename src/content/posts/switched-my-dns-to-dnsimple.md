I decided to drop dreamhost and switch to DNSimple for registering and configuring the DNS for my websites. The price is right and the UX is super smooth.

Since I decided that I was going to move my blog to a simple static site generator
instead of something complicated like rails, I also decided to check out hosting
it somewhere that can handle the amount of traffic it receives... none. As such,
I am going with a free account on heroku. We shall see how this experiment turns out.

**UPDATE 2016-02-21**

It turned out great. I'm still loving this choice.
